# English-to-Roman-Urdu-Translator-using-Dictionary
 Throwback to my 1st Semester Project. This was a comedic projected assisgned to every student in my class by our Computer Programming teacher. The comedic aspect being that some people in my country speak a mix of Urdu and English which is seen by some as off putting. This project aims to replicate that effect of haphazzardly replacing English words with Urdu ones. This project taught us file-handling, string manipulation, and good programming practices.
