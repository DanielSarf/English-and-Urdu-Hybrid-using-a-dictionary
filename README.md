# English-to-Roman-Urdu-Translator-using-Dictionary
This was a comedic project our first semester computer programming teacher assigned to every student in our class, the comedic aspect being that some people in my country use a mix Urdu and English words when speaking (I do this too lol) and some people find it funny/distracting. This project is to emulate that effect. The learning objectives were to teach us file handling, string manipulation and good coding practices.
