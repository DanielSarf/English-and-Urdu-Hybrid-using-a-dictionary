# English and Urdu Hybrid using a dictionary

This project was assigned by our computer programming teacher during the first semester as a comedic exercise. In our country, it's common for people to mix Urdu and English words in conversation, which can be both amusing and distracting. The goal of this project is to emulate that mix of languages.

The primary learning objectives were to teach us:
- File handling
- String manipulation
- Good coding practices

By working on this project, our class was able to gain practical experience in these areas in a fun and engaging way.
