It was Friday and sunny day. I went to a garden. The air was so cool and fresh there. I felt
very good after walking for 10 minutes. There were very beautiful flowers there as well. I
saw a butterfly on one flower with yellow color. I decided to visit the place often after this
beautiful experience... all. these. words. are. not. capitalized. very. cool
