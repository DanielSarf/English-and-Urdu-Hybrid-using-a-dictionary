It was Jumma and sunny din. I went to a gagh. The hawa was so thanda and taza there. I felt
very acha after chalna for 10 minutes. There were very khubsurat flowers there as well. I
dekha a tittli on aik phool with peela rang. I decided to visit the jagah often after this
khubsurat experience... all. these. words. are. not. capitalized. very. thanda
